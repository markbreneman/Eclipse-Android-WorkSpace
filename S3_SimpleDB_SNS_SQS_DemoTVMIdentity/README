Running the AWSAndroidDemoTVMIdentity Sample
============================================
This sample demonstrates interaction with the IdentityTVM.  The IdentityTVM requires the user to register with the 
App by first connecting to an external website and provide a username and password.  The username and username will 
then be required to log into the sample App.  In this sample the registration website is a specific page on the 
IdentityTVM.  

It is assumed that you were able to previously run the AWSAndroidDemo sample.  Also, you need to be running an 
IdentityTVM which this sample App will connect to.

1. Import the project into Eclipse 
   * Go to File -> Import.  Import Wizard will open.
   * Select General -> Existing Projects into Workspace.  Click Next.

   * Select the projects you want to import
   * Click Finish.

2. Update your App configuration:
